# RandlesKWW
Extraction of KWW factor and Effective Capacitance with Siglent Equipment

Description:
Measurement of the capacitance with KWW from a EIS cell.  
Oscilloscope calls and fitting is completed in the Matlab File.
Waveform and combination is completed in the python File.

Connects with TI Visa over LAN.


Hardware:
Working with following Hardware, however, should work on other Siglent Equipment:
STS1104x-E Siglent Oscilloscope
2042X Siglent Waveform Generator

Dependencies:
Uses code from:
